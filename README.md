# Cybersecurity Rooms Walkthrough

This repository contains a series of walkthroughs for various cybersecurity CTF (Capture The Flag) rooms that I have completed. The walkthroughs are intended to provide detailed solutions, explanations, and steps to solve challenges found within these rooms.

## Introduction

CTF rooms are virtual environments where participants can practice cybersecurity skills by tackling diverse challenges such as cryptography, social engineering, vulnerability research, malware analysis, and more. The walkthroughs included here aim to assist other individuals interested in cybersecurity to understand the concepts and techniques used to solve these challenges.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains several walkthroughs of rooms, originating from various learning platforms. Currently, there are only ones from TryHackMe and HackTheBox, but others are to be added!

  - **Easy**
    - [Simple CTF](/TryHackMe/Easy/SimpleCTF/Readme.md)
      - A beginner-level CTF that showcases a few of the necessary skills needed for all CTFs to include scanning and enumeration, research, exploitation, and privilege escalation.

  - **Easy**
    - [Devvortex](/HackTheBox/Easy/Devvortex/Readme.md)
      - Devvortex, a seasonal machine on hack the box released on November 25, 2023. The machine is based on linux operating system and runs a Joomla web application.
    - [Codify](/HackTheBox/Easy/Codify/Readme.md)
      - Codify offered extensive learning on sandbox escape, password cracking, script analysis, and privilege escalation. It involved exploiting a NodeJS code runner for initial access and leveraging enumeration to escalate privileges from 'svc' to 'joshua.' Root access was gained through a vulnerable MySQL backup script with weak password comparison logic. Codify underscores the importance of a diverse skill set across web apps, databases, scripts, authentication, and system administration. Successful hacking in Codify requires thorough enumeration, lateral thinking, and the use of multiple techniques.
    - [Analytics](/HackTheBox/Easy/Analytics/Readme.md)
      - Analytics is a machine on hack the box released on November 25, 2023. The machine is based on linux operating system and runs a Metabase web application.
    - [CozyHosting](/HackTheBox/Easy/CozyHosting/Readme.md)
      - This is an easy machine with a strong focus on web application security vulnerabilities which enables us to get reverse shell of the machine.
    - [Keeper](/HackTheBox/Easy/Keeper/Readme.md)
      - Keeper is an Easy machine which focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the KeePass password manager.
